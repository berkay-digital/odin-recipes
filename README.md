# Recipe Project

## Introduction

This README file provides an overview of the methods used in the Recipe Project. The project aims to present recipes in an organized and user-friendly format using only HTML.

## Methods Used

### 1. Lists

- **Unordered Lists:** To display the ingredients required for each recipe. This helps in presenting a clear and concise list of ingredients.

    ```html
    <ul>
        <li>Ingredient 1</li>
        <li>Ingredient 2</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ul>
    ```

- **Ordered Lists:** To present the step-by-step instructions for preparing each recipe. This ensures that users can easily follow the cooking process.

    ```html
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1</li>
        <li>Step 2</li>
        <li>...</li>
    </ol>
    ```

### 2. Images

- **Images:** Images are added to enhance the user experience and provide a visual representation of the completed dish. These images are embedded using the `<img>` HTML tag.

    ```html
    <img src="image.jpg" alt="Description of the image">
    ```

### 3. Descriptions

- **Description:** A brief description is provided for each recipe to give users an idea of what to expect from the dish. This is added as plain text within the HTML structure.

    ```html
    <p>This is a delicious dish that...</p>
    ```

### 4. Navigation

- **Navigation:** To allow users to easily switch between different recipes, an `index.html` file is provided. This serves as the main page from which users can select the recipe they want to view.

## Usage

Users can simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser to access the collection of recipes. From there, they can click on a recipe of interest to view the ingredients, steps, images, and a brief description of the dish.

## Conclusion

The methods described above were used to create an organized and visually appealing presentation of recipes for the Recipe Project. This design allows users to easily follow recipes and navigate between different dishes using the `index.html` page.
